# Understanding-typescript-with-axios
This is a simple TypeScript/JavaScript code that uses Axios to fetch data from a REST API endpoint. 
The API endpoint is https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos/1. 
The response data is an object that has an id, title, and thumbnailUrl properties, which are used to call the logPhoto function. 
The logPhoto function logs the three properties in a string format to the console.
